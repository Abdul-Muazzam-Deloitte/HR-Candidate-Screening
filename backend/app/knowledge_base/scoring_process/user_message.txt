 Evaluate the CV against the job description using the following **criteria**, scoring each from 1 (very poor match) to 5 (excellent match):
 1. **Technical Skills Match** — Are the tools, languages, platforms, and frameworks used in the CV aligned with those required in the job description?
 2. **Relevance of Experience** — Are the candidate’s past roles and responsibilities similar to what the job demands?
 3. **Years of Experience** — Does the candidate meet or exceed the experience requirement?
 4. **Project/Domain Fit** — Does the candidate have relevant domain experience (e.g., finance, AI, cloud)?
 5. **Soft Skills** — Do they demonstrate communication, leadership, adaptability, teamwork, or client collaboration?
 6. **Education & Certifications** — Do they meet the academic and certification requirements listed in the JD?
 7. **Communication & Formatting** — Is the CV well-written, professional, and easy to follow?

 Return the result in this structured JSON format. Each criterion should include:
 - A score from 1 to 5
 - A short explanation for the score

After scoring, determine whether the candidate should proceed to the next step (assessment). Use the following rule:
 - If the average score is **≥ 4** and overall fit is strong, set `"proceed_to_assessement": "Yes"`
- Otherwise, set `"proceed_to_assessement": "No"`
